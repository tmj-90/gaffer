# "keeps running" mechanism — a thin loop around headless Claude ticks. Re-run it
# from cron/launchd to keep the factory alive across sittings.
#
# Stop conditions (factory.config.sh): MAX_TICKS, EMPTY_POLL_LIMIT, TICK_SLEEP.
# DRY_RUN=1 (default) makes every tick a no-op print.
#
# R-1: DELIBERATELY no `set -e`. This is a long-running supervisor loop and many
# commands here are EXPECTED to return non-zero in normal operation (a tick that
# finds no work, an `expire-claims` with nothing to reap, a `sed` that matches
# nothing). Under `set -e` any of those would abort the whole factory run — the
# opposite of "keep the factory alive across sittings". Instead of a blanket `-e`,
# the CRITICAL state-mutating calls below each carry explicit `|| { … }` handling
# so a real failure there is SURFACED (logged), not silently glided past. `-u`
# (unset-var) and `pipefail` stay on — those catch genuine bugs without aborting
# on expected non-zero exits.
